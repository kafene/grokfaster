Quickie - Speed reading for your browser
=========

This is the first step in making a browser plugin, and eventually maybe other things to get you speed reading a page's contents, especially useful for long news articles.

What's here currently is a concept, and has no styling etc yet, and I'll remove jQuery as it's not at all necessary...

But ideally it'll look good with a nice UI for adjusting WPM and other settings.



Ideas for further developement:
-------------
+ Slider for WPM
+ Figure out the alto for calculating the focal point
+ Fade article to background (transparancy option perhaps?)
+ Style/color different types of text, such as: "text within quotation-marks", (text within parentheses), bold text, italic text, hyphenation, etc etc
+ Style H1 - H5 text (web-based text styling)
+ Pause-button with possibility to break the auto-reading and bringing up the part of the text that you paused at
+ Pay attention to the punctuation such as comma-signs
+ Longer break/pause needed for new sentience (Give time for cognitive understanding that new information begins)
