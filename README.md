Quickie - Speed reading for your browser
=========

This is the first step in making a browser plugin, and eventually maybe other things to get you speed reading a page's contents, especially useful for long news articles.

What's here currently is a concept, and has no styling etc yet, and I'll remove jQuery as it's not at all necessary...

But ideally it'll look good with a nice UI for adjusting WPM and other settings.
